# FizzBuzz is HARD, so I made a RL agent do it instead
This agent utilizes a Q-Learning algorithm to learn the proper actions to perform in this problem.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have python installed
- Install the libraries needed for this project with `pip3 install -r preReqs.txt`

## Running Instructions
- To run the program use `python3 simulation.py <optional: number>`
  - The optional number represents how far you wish to go up to. For example `python3 simulation.py 500` will make the agent train from 1 to 500.
  - If no number is provided, the agent will train on a default value of 100.
